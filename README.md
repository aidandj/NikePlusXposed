Nike+ Running for Pebble
=====================

This little hooks into the Nike+ Running app and modifies the media broadcasts being sent to include
workout information with the intention of being displayed on the pebble.

Currently the information displayed is limited to distance and time - the intention is that in future
this might support multiple applications and configurable formats for displaying the data.

A compiled APK can be downloaded from my [Bintray site](https://bintray.com/jonas/Android/NikePlusXposed).
